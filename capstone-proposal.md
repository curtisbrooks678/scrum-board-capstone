#Project Proposal Template

###Name of Student: Curtis Brooks

##Name of Project: Scrum Board with Analytics

###Project's Purpose or Goal: 
This application will provide users a space to keep track of their tasks and track their efficiency for completing those tasks.

###List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* User has to log in to access application functionality
* User can post new tasks to Scrum Board
* User can move tasks between columns
* User can archive completed tasks
* User can view analytics to see how long a specific task took to complete/move to next column

###What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* Frontend - React (or JavaScript)
* Backend - C#/.NET 
* Database - MySQL
* Data Visualization Library? Need to do more research

###If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* Distinguish tasks and analytics base on specific users (if a manager wanted to use the app to view employee efficiency)
* Host on Azure or Heroku
* Add OAuth for login
* Add complex analytics for task completion using data visualization (specifics to come with more research)
* Drag and drop tasks to different columns, instead of buttons

###What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* Azure or Heroku for hosting
* OAuth for login

###Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
* Although this type of application has been done before, my take of the data visualization will be different than those other applications. I still have quite a bit of planning and researching to do for the data visualization element of this project, which is why there are limited details in the proposal above. I want to make it known that the "scrum board page" is more of a practice of coding skills I've already aquired and the "analytics page" will be more of a stretch goal, but a crucial distinguishing element in my version of this type of application.
