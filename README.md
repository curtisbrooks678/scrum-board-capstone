Research/Planning Notes:

- Research:
    - connecting backend and frontEnd (C#/.NET to React)
        - check out previous cohort's repos
    - scrum boards (make sure you have all necessary information to make one)
    - data visualization (check out Karen's C# team week project)
        - what sorts of data analytics are possible?
        

- Plan:
    - visual representation of site
        - two main "pages":
            - Scrum Board
            - Data Analytics
                - what sorts of data analytics do I want to inlude?
    - component diagram (later)
    - Archive of completed tasks? After done column


- MVP Goals:
    - User can create tasks and track on Scrum Board to completion
    - User can view analytics for task efficiency


- Stretch Goals:
    - Host on Azure (or other hosting platform).
    - OAuth 
    - Complex analytics for task completion using data visualization
    - Drag and drop tasks to different columns
